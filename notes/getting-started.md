# Getting Started

[This is a nice tutorial](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/getting_started.html)

* Best to use `lein` to easily do things
* `lein repl`
* `lein new app proj-name`
* `lein run`
* You can run your project in the repl by `lein repl` in the project directory and then `(-main)`
